1. Read the problem and background

2. Verify that you can read the data provided
The provided the example was "2 2 2". This would make it hard to verify that I 
got the correct variables assigned to the correct values. I used 1 2 3 in my 
file instead. I then wrote the code to put each of these in its own variable 
and printed out each variable to ensure I had the write values in the write places.
#+begin_src ruby
dominant, hetero, recessive = File.read("iprb.txt").chomp.split(' ').map(&:to_i)

puts "Dominant #{dominant}"
puts "Heterozygous #{hetero}"
puts "Recessive #{recessive}
#+end_src

3. Ponder and devise a strategy
My first strategy was to calculate how many ways there were to have the at least 
one dominant allele. Here's some basic thoughts on that

From the background given I know that if one parent has the dominant allele the 
the resulting organism must have the dominant allele.
Probability of one parent have the dominant allel is 

dominant     not-dominant    dominant
--------  + ------------- * ----------
 total         total         total - 1


Then I remembered that since there are fewer ways get two recessive alleles I 
should calculate that instead and then subtract the result from one. (Basic 
law of probabilty).

Maff:
Probability of two recessive parents mating:
recessive    recessive - 1
---------  * -------------
 total        total - 1

Probability of two heterozygous parents mating:
heterozygous     heterozygous - 1
------------  * ------------------
  total           total - 1

Punnet square for heterozygous mating

     |   | Y  | y  |
     |---+----+----|
     | Y | YY | Yy |
     | y | Yy | yy |

Only 1/4 of those will be recessive so we take the probability of two 
heterozygous mating and multiply it by 1/4.

heterozygous     heterozygous - 1      1
------------  * ------------------ * -----
  total           total - 1            4

Finally the probability of a heterozygous and a recessive organism mating:

heterozygous     recessive        recessive     heterozygous
------------  * ------------  + ------------ * --------------
  total           total - 1       total          total - 1


Punnet square for heterozygous & recessive mating

     |   | Y  | y  |
     |---+----+----|
     | y | Yy | yy |
     | y | Yy | yy |

In this case half the offspring have two recessive alleles so multiply the 
probability by 1/2.

4. Write the code
First thing I realized was that we need floats so I had to change the import 
code slightly. I changed the to_i to a to_f.

#+begin_src ruby
dominant, hetero, recessive = File.read("iprb.txt").chomp.split(' ').map(&:to_f)
#+end_src

All my calculations require total so do that once

#+begin_src ruby
total = dominant + hetero + recessive
#+end_src

Now calculate the probability of two recessive organisms mating:

#+begin_src ruby
r_r = (recessive / total) * ((recessive - 1) / (total - 1))
#+end_src

Now heterozygous organisms mating: 
#+begin_src ruby
h_h = (hetero / total) * ((hetero - 1) / (total - 1))
#+end_src

Now the hetero + recessive matings:
#+begin_src ruby
h_r = (hetero / total) * (recessive / (total - 1)) +
  (recessive / total) * (hetero / (total - 1))
#+end_src

Now I incorporate the fractions from the punnet squares:
#+begin_src ruby
recessive_total = r_r + h_h * 1/4 + h_r * 1/2
#+end_src
        
This is the probability of a recessive organism. The problem asked for the 
probability of a dominant organism so I take 1 - recessive_total
#+begin_src ruby
puts 1 - recessive_total
#+end_src

All together:
#+begin_src ruby
dominant, hetero, recessive = File.read("iprb.txt").chomp.split(' ').map(&:to_f)

total = dominant + hetero + recessive

r_r = (recessive / total) * ((recessive - 1) / (total - 1))
h_h = (hetero / total) * ((hetero - 1) / (total - 1))
h_r = (hetero / total) * (recessive / (total - 1)) +
  (recessive / total) * (hetero / (total - 1))

recessive_total = r_r + h_h * 1/4 + h_r * 1/2
puts 1 - recessive_total
1 - recessive_total
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.7833333333333333

This matches the expected result.
